# variable is basically just a way to give a (meaningful) name to an area of memory,#into which we can place certain values.

 #few rules
 #Python variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore_character
 #They can contain letters, numbers or underscore characters
 #Python variables are case sensitive, so greeting and Greeting would be 2 different variables
 #Variables are created when they are first attached to a value using the =

 greeting = "Hello"
 age = 19
 name = "Brenden"

 print(age)
 print(type(greeting))
 print(type(age))

 age_in_words = "2 years"
 print(age)
 print(type(age))
